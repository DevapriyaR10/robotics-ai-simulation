# Robotics + UML + Generative AI Simulation

This project simulates a robotics control system typically used in competitions.  
It includes:
- **Microcontroller-style motor & sensor simulation** (C++)  
- **UML-based design** for requirements and architecture  
- **Generative AI integration** for task planning  

The project is designed for academic showcase and portfolio use (no real hardware required).

---

## Features
- Motor control simulation (forward, backward, stop, rotate).  
- Sensor simulation (obstacle detection).  
- Generative AI stub (suggests optimal next moves).  
- UML diagrams for requirements & class structure.  
- Modular C++ codebase with headers & implementation.
